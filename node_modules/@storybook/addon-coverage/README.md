# Storybook Addon Coverage

Tools to support code coverage in Storybook and the [Storybook test runner](https://github.com/storybookjs/test-runner). It supports Storybook projects that use **Webpack5** or **Vite**.

### Installation

Install this addon by adding the `@storybook/addon-coverage` dependency:

```sh
yarn add -D @storybook/addon-coverage
```

And by registering it in your `.storybook/main.js`:

```js
export default {
  addons: ["@storybook/addon-coverage"],
};
```

### Configuring the addon

This addon instruments your code by using a custom wrapper around [istanbul-lib-instrument](https://www.npmjs.com/package/istanbul-lib-instrument) if your project uses Webpack5 or [vite-plugin-istanbul](https://github.com/iFaxity/vite-plugin-istanbul) if your project uses Vite. It provides some default configuration, but if you want to add yours, you can do so by setting the options in your `.storybook/main.js`:

```js
export default {
  addons: [
    {
      name: "@storybook/addon-coverage",
      options: {
        istanbul: {
          include: ["**/stories/**"],
        },
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

**The available options if your project uses Webpack5 are as follows:**

## Troubleshooting

### The coverage addon doesn't support optimized builds

The `--test` flag is designed to be as fast as possible, removing addons known to slow down the build and are not needed for functional testing. One of these addons is `@storybook/addon-coverage`, which is used in conjunction with the Storybook Test runner to collect coverage information for your stories.

If you are using `addon-coverage` **AND** running the test runner against your _built_ Storybook, the `--test` flag will strip out the coverage information. To configure the `--test` build to keep coverage information (at the expense of a slightly slower build), update your Storybook configuration file (i.e.,`.storybook/main.js|ts`) and include the [`disabledAddons`](https://storybook.js.org/docs/api/main-config-build#testdisabledaddons) option.

```js
// main.js

export default {
  // Your Storybook configuration goes here
  build: {
    test: {
      disabledAddons: [
        '@storybook/addon-docs',
        '@storybook/addon-essentials/docs',
      ],
    },
  },
}
```

### Development scripts

- `yarn start` runs babel in watch mode
- `yarn build` build and package your addon code

To run the examples, choose one of the projects in the `examples` directory then run:

- `yarn` to install dependencies and link the addon locally
- `yarn storybook` to run Storybook
- `yarn test-storybook --coverage` to test coverage report generation
