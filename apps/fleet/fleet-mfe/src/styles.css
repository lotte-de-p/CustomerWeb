/*
    !DO NOT ADD CSS HERE!

    This file is local to the SPA only. It does not get exposed via the MFE Components.
    For now, the way of working is to duplicate CSS to component-level CSS where it is required.

    If large amounts of CSS are shared between components, we could look into creating separate CSS files, which would get
    injected as a component stylesheet, as those are exposed via the MFE Components.
